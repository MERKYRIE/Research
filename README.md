# Introduction
Many games have been using a tilemap or its derivatives (octree as a three-dimensional approach).
Simulating worlds effectively in terms of memory and performance has been always being a problem.
The goal is to show how to optimize a tilemap (a two-dimensional level data structure).
# State of the Art
I have been searching a lot for any already existing information about the chosen subject.
Unfortunately, I've failed to find an exhaustive reference around this topic, only the plain ones.
I'm still sure it's somewhere out there but I'm basing my research on flat grounds.
